# Contacts android App

- Folder architecture
- Connection to "API"
- ListView to show the Contacts
- Custom Font,  Icons and styles
- Image Manager (Cache)
- Scroll update
- Search on action bar

**Language**

I decided to use a combination of Java and Kotlin because I have more experience in Java and also wanted to learn a little more about how to implement some things in Kotlin and I took advantage of this mini project to learn it.

**External library**

I decided to use Retrofit as a Rest Client and GSON to help me to convert the object from the API into JSON.

For images, I used Picasso because is one of the lighter libraries to manage images. And a library to show it rounded.
